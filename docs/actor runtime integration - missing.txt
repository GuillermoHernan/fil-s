* Add header 'system_interface' (or its contents)
* Add 'Timer' actor. It would have some (all?) 'C' code.
* Input message function will always have the parameters parameter. The dispatcher
cannot know if it has parameters in advance.
* Function or actor to write output signals. An actor is preferred.
* Actor to read input signals.
* Code generator for message send calls.
* Separate simulator-specific code from generic runtime code. The generic code shall be written in 'C'.

* As a derivative of these requirements, it is needed the mechanism to write actors
in 'C'.
