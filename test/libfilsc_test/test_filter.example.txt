This file is an example of the file to set the filter for the unit tests. 
Only the first line is taken into account. Therefore, the rest of the file can be used
to add comments or disabled filters.
Because only the first line is used, one of the easiest ways to disable the filter
is just to begin the file with a new line.
The real filter file (test_filter) has been added to '.gitignore', as it is a local
configuration file.
